# About ColorCordia

## General

This project was created as a part of [Full stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course at the University of Helsinki.

The live version of the project can be found at [colorcordia.com](https://www.colorcordia.com/)

## Features

### Color wheel & palette creation

Users can pick from any of the 16 581 375 colors represented in RGB color space, and ColorCordia creates all calculable color harmonies fomr the chosen color in additive color space. The succeeding palettes can be tweaked, and once a palette is chosen, ColorCordia finds names for all of the harmonies colors. The palettes can be downloaded as .png files, or for logged in users shared within the ColorCordia community for others to enjoy. ColorCordia also provides functionality to create derivative palettes from the one chosen. 

### Explore

Users can explore palettes created by other users. For logged in users, it is also possible to like other peoples (or your own) palettes. These palettes can also be downloaded as .png files

### Scheme visualiser

Users can test their palettes using 3 different UI-layouts. The user can randomize the palette, choose from ones created by the community, or if they are logged in, their own shared palettes.

### Color converter

Users can convert colors between HEX, RGB, HSV, and NCS color systems. Note: NCS color system is based on the perception of color, not the composition of the color itself, which might cause inaccuracies between the color represented on the screen versus a physical color model. ColorCordia and its creators are not responsible for color inaccuracies caused by users terminal device.

### User profile

Logged in users can view their shared palettes, and statistics about them, here or delete unwanted palettes from their account. Password can be changed via the User profile.

### Login & Signup

After signup the user can log in. The user stays logged in for 7 days. After a week, the user must log in again.
