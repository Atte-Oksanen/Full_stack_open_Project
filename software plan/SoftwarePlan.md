# ColorCordia (WIP)

## About

This project is made to act as the main deliverable to the Full Stack Open practice work course extension organized by the University of Helsinki. 

## Software

This software is a React/Node based webapp that creates harmonious color schemes from user input with some additional features like color system conversion
and scheme visualization. The app also includes social aspects in the form of an explore page, where users can see uploaded schemes from other users.

## Functionalities

* Color picker
  * A classic colorwheel type picker, where the user can freely choose a color with their pointer
  * The wheel must show the picked color in real time

* Scheme generator
  * A color scheme generator based on HSV/RGB color
  * Can create atleast analogous, complementary and triad schemes
  * Also possibly creates schemes based on RYB model

* Scheme visualizer
  * A color scheme visualizing tool that provides template web designs to test colours in

* Converter
    * Color system converter that can convert to most used color systems in the Nordics
    * rgb, hsv, ncs (ncs is a reductive color system, so the addition of RYB schemes would be most beneficial here)

* Social aspects
    * The app would include users and profiles, which are linked to shared schemes
    * Users could share their schemes and view schemes created by other people
